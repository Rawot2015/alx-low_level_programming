0. This program generates a random integer value for the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints if the number is positive, negative or zero.

1. This program generates a random integer value for the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints its last digit along with whether it is greater than 5, less than 6 (but not 0) or equal to 0.

2. This program uses putchar function to print lowercase English alphabets in a new line using only two putchar functions within main() function.

3. This program uses putchar function to print both uppercase and lowercase English alphabets in separate lines using only three putchar functions within main() function.

4. This program prints all letters of lowercase English alphabet except 'q' and 'e' on separate lines using only two putchar functions within main() function.

5. This program prints all single-digit numbers from base10 starting from zero on a new line, written entirely inside main() block

6. In this code we are printing single-digit numbers from base10 starting from zero without declaring any character type data structures by calling only putchar twice inside our code block

7.This code writes out characters in reverse order that represent lower case english alphabets ending at letter "a" 

8.In this C-programming source code we use nested loops to write hexadecimal numbers ranging from decimal values [0-15] as their equivalent hexadecimal digits into standard output stream  

9.Prints out all possible combinations of single-digit integers separated by comma followed by space on one line sorted in ascending order such that no combination repeats itself more than once 

10.Prints out all unique pairs of different digits separated by commas followed by spaces so that smallest pair comes first e.g.,(01 instead of 10). Only five calls to Putchar allowed per execution run

11.Prints out all unique triplets of different digits separated by commas followed by spaces so that smallest triplet comes first e.g.,(012 instead of 120,102). Only six calls to Putchar allowed per execution run

12. Prints out all unique pairs of two-digit numbers separated by a space and comma (in ascending order) from the range [0-99]. All numbers are printed with leading zero if they are less than ten. Only eight calls to Putchar allowed per execution run
